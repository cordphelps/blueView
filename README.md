## this is a sandbox for checking the awesome API interface [BluetoothLE](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE). 

The interface (3 jQuery Mobile pages via PhoneGapBuild) steps through the basic connectivity functions, displaying status messages to a textarea in the app. 



## open issues:

- I can't subscribe() or write() to the published ReadBear (BLE Shield 2.1) service "713d0000-503e-4c75-ba94-3148f18d941e", I'm getting 'service not found'
